TODO

* Replace old style /etc/hosts with vagrant-hostmanager once it's all fixed up.
* Find an elegant way to decide what to do to each docker container after pull.
* Figure out what to do about DNS and networking issues in the containers.
* Have a way to pass structured or non-string facts into the vms.
** Puppet could support a B64FACTER_name=... where the data is a base64 yaml.
*** This would be useful anyways, but isn't the ideal approach for vagrant.
** One way could be to write to /etc/facter/facts.d/ before each puppet run.
