            For this lesson, please do the following:
            * create a variable that holds your name
            * create a second variable with some text that interpolates the first variable
            * notify the user of the longer message, using the short variable as the name

            Bonus:
            * show a different message if the first variable has the name 'james'
            * test your code to ensure it works if the first variable is the empty string
            * lastly:
            ** define the variable $two = 'two'
            ** define the variable $twopotato to contain some value
            ** 'notify' out the string: 'onepotatotwopotato'
            ** ensure where the 'two' portion of the above string comes from the $two var

            Happy hacking!\n",
