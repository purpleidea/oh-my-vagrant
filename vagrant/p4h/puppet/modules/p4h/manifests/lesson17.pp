For this lesson, please do the following:
* Try out the hiera data-in-modules technique
** Can you use it for defining types ?
*** Further complicate your life by learning the os-independent puppet part
**** It's actually quite elegant, but it's not fun for the initial module code
***** And regrettably, it makes your code look a bit less readable than before

Bonus:
* Submit a patch for Puppet-IPA or Puppet-Gluster to enhance the coverage
* Test this feature in the Puppet-IPA git master :)

Level 42:
* Port one of my existing modules to use this feature
** Pick a 'good module' (that I care about) and not something old and unloved!
* Promise to continuously test git master of one of my modules that uses this
** On a different OS than what I test/hack/devel on...
*** Better yet, convince someone in the Ubuntu community to do so...
**** I'd say 'Debian', but their wavering stance on systemd will be their death
***** http://linux.slashdot.org/story/14/11/08/1448234/joey-hess-resigns-from-debian
****** They need to go 100% systemd, ASAP, and help out with patches as needed!

Happy hacking!\n",
