# README: this is a module built for use with: Oh My Vagrant!

class p4h::prep5() {

	file { '/root/README':
		content => "##prep5
For this lesson, please do the following:
* create a simple class that creates a file, and include it here
** it will need to go in a separate file because you can't nest classes
* create a second class and include it from the first (is this ever useful?)
* include a class twice in the manifest
* one of the classes should have two parameters with default values too
** use those parameters in the text of the file that your class creates

Hint:
* the class will have to have the same module prefix as this class (p4h)
* if the class is named p4h::foo, it should exist in a foo.pp file in this dir
* remember that classes are singletons, design with that in mind

Bonus:
* include a class using the 'resource-like' definition
* create the class as part of a separate module, and include it here

Happy hacking!\n",
