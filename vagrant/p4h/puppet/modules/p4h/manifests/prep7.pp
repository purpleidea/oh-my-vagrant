		content => "##prep7
For this lesson, please do the following:
* create two 'defined types' (aka a type)
* types can't be nested inside classes, so create them in separate files
* your types should create a file and perhaps do something else as well
* use the types twice, and make sure there's no conflict (duplicate definition)
* create a before/require dependency between a type and something else

Hint:
* remember, types aren't singletons, but their names must be unique!
* remember, types aren't functions as they don't return values
* remember, types should use their name as the point of uniqueness
** if other parameters should be unique, use them in an alias metaparam
* for a type named: p4h::bar, it will have to exist in bar.pp in this dir

Bonus:
* create some types as part of your module, which should also have classes
* explain and demonstrate (by example) why before/require are both needed

Happy hacking!\n",
