		content => "##lesson13
For this lesson, please do the following:
* Create a type on one machine (eg: a file) as an exported resource
* Collect this type on a second machine
* Export a second type, and then override a property on collection
* Use a matching expression to filter the collection
* Think about how we can do this for dynamic, whitelisted, firewalling
* Q: At what point in the run sequence does the type actually get 'exported' ?
* Q: Can we export classes ?

Bonus:
* Export a type, that itself, when compiled, exports another type back...
* When does that second internal 'exported resource' get exported ?
* Wrap the collection part in a class or a type so it's easy to use...
* Think of a use case for this feature
* Name a shortcoming / drawback of this feature
* Convince someone to pull shorewall into RHEL (as an optional feature)

Level 42:
* Nest your exported resources and collections to the third degree
* Think of three use cases for this feature
* Try out the automatic firewalling with puppet-shorewall

Happy hacking!\n",
