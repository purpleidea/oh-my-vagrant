For this lesson, please do the following:
* Read the 'Hybrid Management' blog post I wrote about this subject
** https://ttboj.wordpress.com/2014/07/24/hybrid-management-of-freeipa-types-with-puppet/
* Try to understand this technique and follow the code
** Try to understand what the $type_excludes do
*** Realize that this uses an extended, more complex form of clean.sh.erb
** Try to understand the difference between $watch and $modify
*** Don't feel bad about this, I forget which is which sometimes too :)
* IMHO, this is a critical technique for keeping the harmony at Red Hat
** This way different product teams can have their UI's and I can have my glue!

Bonus:
* There's no bonus, all patches that are correct take you to 'Level 42'
** (Don't pass go, go directly to 'Level 42')

Level 42:
* Patch puppet-ipa so that it accepts creation time exclusions
** It will be useful if you look at this for reference:
*** https://www.redhat.com/archives/freeipa-devel/2014-July/msg00349.html
* Write a generalized clean.sh.erb, that is lib-ified and in python :)
* Think of an idea for additional exclusionary criteria

Happy hacking!\n",
