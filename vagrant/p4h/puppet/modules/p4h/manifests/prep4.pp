For this lesson, please do the following:
* create a simple inline template (erb template)
* create a template that spits out a message using the @hostname fact
* create an inline template that adds two puppet variables together
* create a file that uses the contents of one of your templates
* create one of the templates in the p4h/templates/ directory (name it sth.erb)

Bonus:
* create a template that has some light programming contained (ruby code)

Level 42:
* create a template that writes a file to the file system (is this useful?)
* create a template that spits out the value from /usr/bin/hostname system call

Happy hacking!\n",
