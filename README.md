# *Oh-My-Vagrant*: This is: Oh My Vagrant!

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/purpleidea/oh-my-vagrant.png)](http://travis-ci.org/purpleidea/oh-my-vagrant)

## Documentation:
Please see: [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md) or [PDF](https://pdfdoc-purpleidea.rhcloud.com/pdf/https://github.com/purpleidea/oh-my-vagrant/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Installation:
Please read the [INSTALL](INSTALL) file for instructions on getting this installed.

## Examples:
Please look in the [examples/](examples/) folder for usage. If none exist, please contribute one!

## Module specific notes:

* This was born as 'vagrant-puppet-docker-template'...
* I decided it could be more useful as a general project...
* I renamed it because the original name was dumb...
* The current name is obviously a nod to the success of the 'oh-my-zsh' project, although I'm actually a bash user :)
* It is an attempt to provide a general purpose environment to make it easier to get hacking on vagrant+puppet+docker things.
* There are still some unresolved issues, but it can be useful as reference, or as a starting point for a hacker to customize.
* An intro article about this environment is available:
** [https://ttboj.wordpress.com/2014/09/03/introducing-oh-my-vagrant/](https://ttboj.wordpress.com/2014/09/03/introducing-oh-my-vagrant/)

## Dependencies:
* vagrant (available in Fedora 21+)
** [https://github.com/pradels/vagrant-libvirt/](vagrant-libvirt) (available in Fedora 21+)

Note: If you are using VirtualBox as hypervisor, there is no need to depend on vagrant-libvirt.
